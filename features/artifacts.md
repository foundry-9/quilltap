# Feature: Artifacts

- If there is anything that could be displayed or rendered and displayed, like Markdown or HTML, then it should show up on the right side of the screen, bumping the chat to the left side, like the Chat Debug screen does. Hovering over it should allow two buttons, like we have over chat messages, only this time the buttons are "copy" and "download."
