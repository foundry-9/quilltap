# Feature Request: Memory

Every character should have a memory that updates and cleans itself up automatically as we chat with the character.

## Prerequisites and Plans

- [ ] Cheap LLM for summarization and housecleaning
- [ ] Separate storage of memories that are associated with a given character
- [ ] Each memory should have content, keywords (string array), tags (tag array derived from character, persona, conversation tags)
- [ ] Memories should auto-form based on conversations
- [ ] There should be, in the character view/edit pages, an interface to view/edit memories
- [ ] There should be full CRUD support for memories
